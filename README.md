This started as a exercise to learn [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and ES6 and actually became an over-engineered CV builder... It takes a `.json` file with the CV data and builds a single static `.html` file that can be used both as a [static website](https://cv.andreev.sh/) and as an email attachment. It is responsive, progressively enhanced (everything but the timeline works without JS), bundled (all assets are inlined, no network requests are made) and minified. It also has separate print styles that produce a normal-looking CV suitable for printing/PDF export (works best with Chrome at the moment due to some Firefox issues).

I've not yet put any effort at making it usable by other people. As the [TODO](TODO.md) list suggests, it needs serious refactoring and a lot of documentation and explanations. I intend to get some real-world feedback (a.k.a. apply for some jobs) before revisiting this and making it a usable open-source project. Until then, use at your own headache :).
